**1. Iluminâncias por classe de tarefas visuais:**

* A norma apresenta uma tabela (Tabela 1) que relaciona tipos de atividades a classes de iluminância (A, B, C), cada uma com um valor de iluminância (lux). 
* Essa classificação leva em conta a dificuldade da tarefa visual, indo de atividades com requisitos visuais limitados (Classe A - 200 lux) até tarefas visuais muito especiais, como cirurgias (Classe C - valores superiores).

**2. Fatores determinantes da iluminância adequada:**

* **Idade do observador:**  A norma considera que a necessidade de iluminância aumenta com a idade, utilizando um sistema de pesos (-1, 0, +1) para determinar a influência da idade na escolha da iluminância.
* **Velocidade e precisão da tarefa:** Tarefas rápidas e que exigem precisão demandam maior iluminância. A norma também utiliza pesos (-1, 0, +1) para classificar a importância da velocidade e precisão.
* **Reflectância do fundo da tarefa e do observador:** Superfícies mais claras refletem mais luz, exigindo menor iluminância. A norma classifica a reflectância em três níveis, utilizando pesos para determinar sua influência.

**3. Seleção da iluminância:**

* A norma recomenda analisar os três fatores acima para determinar a iluminância adequada. 
* Em cada caso, a norma sugere três valores de iluminância: um valor médio (a ser utilizado na maioria dos casos), um valor alto (para situações com baixa reflectância, alto contraste, tarefas críticas ou usuários com baixa visão) e um valor baixo (para tarefas ocasionais ou com alta reflectância).

**4. Iluminância em lux, por tipo de atividade:**

* A norma detalha valores de iluminância para diversos ambientes de trabalho, como escritórios, escolas, hospitais, indústrias, etc. 
* Para cada tipo de ambiente, são apresentados valores de iluminância para diferentes áreas e atividades específicas.

**5. Outros aspectos relevantes:**

* A iluminância deve ser medida no campo de trabalho, a 0,75m do piso.
* É possível utilizar iluminação suplementar para aumentar a iluminância em áreas específicas.
* A iluminância em qualquer ponto do campo de trabalho não deve ser inferior a 70% da iluminância média.

Em resumo, a NBR 5413/1992 define critérios claros e específicos para determinar a iluminância adequada em ambientes de trabalho, considerando as características das tarefas, do ambiente e dos usuários. A aplicação correta da norma garante um ambiente visualmente confortável, seguro e produtivo.
